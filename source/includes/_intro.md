# Introduction

**UPDATE: A new version has been released. You can read more about it here: [Pakkelabels.dk API v3](https://api.pakkelabels.dk)**

This is the official API for pakkelabels.dk. The version is **v2**. Should we introduce any new changes in the API which will break the structure of any existing API calls, these new changes will be introduced in a new version. This ensures that any systems which integrates up against our system will not be affected. 

We provide an [official library for PHP](https://github.com/pakkelabels/php)
