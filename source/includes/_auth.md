# Authentication
All calls to the API must contain a token. To obtain such a token, you need to call the login method under the users ressource (see below).

To login, you need a **api_user** and **api_key**. These can be generated once you are logged under [Settings -> API](https://app.pakkelabels.dk/main/app/#/setting/api)
