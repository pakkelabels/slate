Create a shipment. The price of the shipment is automatically substracted from your balance. If the balance of the user is not enough, an error will be raised.
Once the shipment has been created, the base64 encoding of the label is returned in **base64**.

<aside class="notice">
When testing, set the paramter test to true. You can then create labels even if your balance is zero.
